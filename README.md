# My-Portfolio-Website-Wireframe

Here is my plan for a website. I just have to not be cheap and actually spend the money to publish it, lol.

I decided to use my favorite colors red and purple. We are also seeing trends that favor dark mode so that is why the website is dark throughout. 

I was also able to create a logo using my initials. I was pretty proud of the results.

This is just a High Fidelity Wireframe that I made in Figma.

But if anyone is interested in talking about my project more, please feel free to reach out at any time! Wishing everyone the best :)
